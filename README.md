# Data Cleaning and EDA with Time Series Data

Cleaning and exploring your data is a crucial first step in any data project. In this assignment you will practice these skills on a real IoT dataset of electricity consumption data for a single household over four years. You will practice normalizing datatypes, handling missing data, visualizing and regularizing time series data, and identifying covariance in your data. 

### Instructions: 

1. Create a repository under your GitHub account from this template: https://github.com/amarbut/aai-iot-cleaning-and-eda. Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). Make your repository [private](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility) and add your instructorâ€™s Github account as a [collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository). 

2. Following the instructions in the jupyter notebook from the above Github template, perform basic data cleaning steps on the Household Electric Consumption Dataset which can be downloaded [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption#) .

3. Also following the instructions in the jupyter notebook, perform an explanatory data analysis on the cleaned dataset, including visualizations typical for time series data and a consideration of covariance between variables in the dataset.
